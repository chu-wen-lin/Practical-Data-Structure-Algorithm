**Task**:
Given a list of restaurants, write a function to filter restaurants by rate, price and distance.

The attributes of a restaurant are given as four integers in this order: `id`, `rate`, `price`, `distance`. We guarantee `id` is unique and `min_price <= max_price`. The `rate` attribute has only five possible values: 1,2,3,4 or 5.

To filter the list, we will give you `min_price`, `max_price`, `min_rate`. Please return the restaurantsâ€™ `id` that meets the condition: `min_price <= price <= max_price` and `rate >= min_rate`.

The output is an integer list, which should be in the *increasing* order of `distance`; if there are restaurants whose `distance` equals, order the restaurants' `id` from the *largest to the smallest*.

In case6, we want you to implement two comparators for the class Restaurant. One is the natural order, which should be implemented by the comparable interface (java), the other one is a comparator object/method (called `Comparator1`).

For example, there is a list of restaurants, `r :list[Restaurant]`. `sorted(r)` will sort the array by calling the natural comparator. Similarly, `sorted(r, cmp=Comparator1)` will sort the list by `Comparator1`. See more details in the template block below.

The natural comparator should order the restaurants by the formula `distance * price / rate`, if the value is the same, keep the same order as input.

The `comparator1` should order the restaurants by the rate in *increasing* order, distance in *increasing* order (if tied), and id in *decreasing* order (if tied again).

**Test Case**: Total 100 points. <BR> 
1. `0 <= Distance`, `Price <= 10000`, `0 <= id <= 10000000`
2. The number of times of query(calling filter) will less than 1000
3. `N` refers to the number of restaurants
4. `M` refers to the total length of output for each sample(The total length of filter output for each class after initiation)
<BR>  
- 20 points: `N = 10`, `M < 100`
- 20 points: `N = 100000`, `M < 1000000`. Special Case
